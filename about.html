            <h4>Founder & President</h4>
            <p>
                Hi! I am Sid Siddem, a junior at Lake Washington High School and an avid chess lover. 
                I have been playing chess competitively since 5th grade, and I have enjoyed my chess 
                journey so far. I founded RCC with the mission to provide more chess opportunities
                 to aspiring players in the Bellevue/Redmond/Sammamish area and host USCF events. 
                  I also have had experience working as a Chess Coach online before at 425KidsChess,
                  teaching casual players methods to improve. Along with hosting tournaments and coaching, I also enjoy competing in 
                   tournaments. I have a peak NWSRS rating of 1750 and a USCF rating of 1350, 
                   and I tied for 3rd/4th in the Washington State Chess Championship 
                   2023(Rising Stars Section). I also represented Team Washington 
                   in the 10th grade division in the WA VS BC Intermat in Spring 2024. 
                   In my free time, I also enjoy playing on Chess.com(Rapid Rating ~2000), 
                   and participating in various extracurriculars at my school such as DECA,
                    TSA, and MUN. Hope to see you playing at RCC tournaments!
            </p>

            <h2>Christos Boulis</h2>
            <h4>Vice President</h4>
            <p>Hello, I am Christos Boulis, I am a junior at Northwest High School 
                a private school in the Capitol Hill Area.  I have been playing chess since I was 6 years old but started taking chess seriously in 6th grade. 
                I am one of the people working with RCC to provide chess opportunities to chess players all throughout the Seattle area.
                 I have a USCF Rating of 1841 and a Fide rating of 1832. 
                 I am still an avid tournament player, even though high school has gotten very busy. 
                Some of my best accomplishments were winning the U2100 Vegas Regional open back in August 2022 
                and getting tying for first place in the U2000 Portland open back in 2023.  
                Outside of chess I am an avid tutor at my school helping kids primarily with math and SAT prep, 
                and a student athlete: Weightlifting, Track, Frisbee. I am really excited to be working 
                with RCC and hope to see you (and maybe even challenge you!) on the board. </p>
